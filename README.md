THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER UPDATED!

This version of the project was made with jquery and is fully functional. jQuery turns out to be an excellent addittion to websites which need a little bit of code but in this project my jquery files were literally blowing up and I felt like it wasn't filling my needs. If you wish to run this build, you will have to: 1. execute queries in sql.txt to SQL server DB 2. Get the youtube apikey 3. run it with VS 2015.

I decided to move forward with this project with Angular 2. Although I kept the same backend it is still growing and changing to fit the Angular 2 version.
